# General description
This project showcases different implementations of the same business requirements, aiming to highlight the diverse approaches to solving identical problems and emphasizing the strengths and weaknesses of each solution.

It is important to note that none of the solutions presented are deemed "the best."

Each implementation adheres to the same business requirements, starting from simpler architectures and gradually moving towards more complex ones. It's crucial to understand that a more "complex" solution does not inherently imply superiority.

Accompanying each solution, there will be an additional description to explain the rationale behind the choices made and to discuss the merits and drawbacks of each approach.

This repository is intended to offer insight into different methodologies for addressing the same issue, facilitating a deeper understanding of their respective advantages and disadvantages.

In the context of determining the quality of a specific architecture, the answer invariably hinges on the specifics of the scenario.
