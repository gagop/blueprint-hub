# Short descrition
This repository stores examples of various implementations based on the same business requirements. The repository was created as an example of different ways to solve the same problem. 
None of the presented solutions is considered perfect. 
Each solution presents certain advantages and disadvantages. 
Whether a given architecture is appropriate for a specific problem always depends on the context of the decisions being made. I hope that this repository will help to show a broader picture of different kinds of approaches.

# Introduction to business requirements
Our repository will implement a certain set of business requirements. In the presented examples, we want to show both simpler and more complex use cases. For this reason, our business domain must possess a certain level of complexity. On the other hand, we obviously do not want the complexity of the presented domain to hinder the understanding of the examples. 
For this reason, we have chosen a domain that will probably be at least partially familiar to the reader - it will be the sphere of higher education institutions' functioning. Of course, for the purposes of our examples, we will simplify the real business processes a bit and focus only on a few of them. It will therefore be an excerpt of a somewhat simplified reality, which I hope will be enough to present both simpler and more complex implementation examples.
